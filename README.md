   - `xlsx.full.min.js` (Excel processing library)

### Step 2: Set Permissions

### Method 2: Embed in SharePoint Page

1. **Create a New Page**:
   - In SharePoint, go to "Pages" in the left navigation
   - Click "New" â†’ "Page"
   - Choose a template or start with a blank page

2. **Add Web Part**:
   - Click the "+" icon to add a web part
   - Select "Embed" or "Script Editor" web part
   - If using Embed, you'll need to host the file elsewhere first

3. **Alternative - Direct Link**:
   - Create a link web part
   - Link to the `index.html` file URL from your document library
   - Set it to open in a new window/tab

### Method 3: SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Extension

For advanced integration:

1. **Create SPFx Extension**:
   ```bash
   yo @microsoft/sharepoint
   # Select "Extension" â†’ "Application Customizer"
   ```

2. **Embed the HTML**:
   - Copy the HTML content into your extension
   - Deploy as a SharePoint Framework solution

### Method 4: Modern Page with iframe

1. **Create Modern Page**:
   - Go to "Pages" â†’ "New" â†’ "Page"
   - Add a "Text" web part

2. **Add iframe Code**:
   ```html
   <iframe src="[YOUR_SHAREPOINT_SITE]/[DOCUMENT_LIBRARY]/index.html" 
           width="100%" 
           height="800px" 
           frameborder="0">
   </iframe>
   ```

## Configuration Options

### Customizing File Limits
Edit the following constants in the JavaScript section:
```javascript
this.maxFiles = 10;        // Maximum number of files
this.maxFileSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB per file
```

### Styling Customization
The application uses Bootstrap 5 for styling. You can:
- Modify the CSS variables in the `<style>` section
- Change color schemes by updating the Bootstrap classes
- Adjust the gradient in the header section

### Sheet Naming Convention
The application automatically generates sheet names based on filenames. To modify this behavior, edit the `generateSheetName()` method.

## Security Considerations

- **Client-Side Only**: All processing happens in the browser
- **No Data Transmission**: Files never leave the user's device
- **File Validation**: Strict validation prevents malicious file uploads
- **CDN Dependencies**: Uses trusted CDNs for Bootstrap and SheetJS

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: 60+ (Recommended)
- **Firefox**: 55+
- **Safari**: 12+
- **Edge**: 79+
- **Internet Explorer**: Not supported (uses ES6+ features)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Files Not Uploading**:
   - Check file size (must be < 5MB)
   - Verify file format (.xlsx or .xls only)
   - Ensure browser supports FileReader API

2. **Processing Errors**:
   - Verify SheetJS library loaded correctly
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure files are not corrupted

3. **Download Not Working**:
   - Check if browser blocks pop-ups
   - Verify sufficient disk space
   - Try different browser if issues persist

### SharePoint-Specific Issues

1. **File Access Denied**:
   - Check SharePoint permissions
   - Ensure user has "Read" access to the document library

2. **Page Not Loading**:
   - Verify the file uploaded correctly
   - Check SharePoint site settings for custom scripts
   - Try accessing the file directly via URL

3. **iframe Issues**:
   - Some SharePoint configurations block iframe embedding
   - Use direct file access instead of iframe

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Drag and drop Excel files onto the upload zone
   - Or click the zone to browse and select files
   - Supported formats: .xlsx and .xls files

2. **Process Files**:
   - Click "Consolidate Files" button
   - Watch the progress bar as files are processed
   - Each uploaded file becomes a separate sheet

3. **Download Result**:
   - Click "Download Consolidated Excel File"
   - The browser will download a new .xlsx file
   - Open it to verify all sheets are included
